        Those interactions describe the different engagements the system may undergo and follow the logic below
            I       Peer-to-Peer        (P -> P)
            II      Peer-to-Machine     (P -> M)
            III     Machine-to-Machine  (M -> M)
            IV      Machine-to-Peer     (M -> P)
