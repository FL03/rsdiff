   Description:
        Welcome to the acme sdk, an all-in-one toolkit enabling developers to create optimized
        Ethereum Native blockchains. Initially, this was created in an attempt to standardize
        the on-going efforts of Scattered-Systems and was inspired from pre-existing blockchain
         frameworks like Ignite CLI for Cosmos and Substrate from Parity for Polkadot.
